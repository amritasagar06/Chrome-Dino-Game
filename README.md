# Chrome-Dino-Game

A fully functional clone of the classic Chrome Dino Game built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. This project focuses on game mechanics, animation timing, collision detection, and clean JavaScript structuring without any external libraries.

## Features

* Character jump animation
* Automatic obstacle generation
* Collision detection
* Score counter
* Game restart logic
* Smooth gameplay using requestAnimationFrame
* Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3 (animations, responsive layout)
* JavaScript (game loop, physics, collision detection)

## Project Structure

index.html
style.css
script.js

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in any modern browser
   No installation or server required.

## What I Learned

* Implementing game loops with requestAnimationFrame
* Creating smooth animations using CSS and JavaScript
* Detecting collisions with bounding boxes
* Handling keyboard events for player controls
* Better naming conventions (my biggest area of improvement)
* Writing cleaner, more modular JavaScript logic
